        <h1 id="Louisiana-Poised-to-Begin-Sports-Betting-in-2018"><a href="#Louisiana-Poised-to-Begin-Sports-Betting-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Poised to Begin Sports Betting in 2018"></a>Louisiana Poised to Begin Sports Betting in 2018</h1><p> Louisiana is on the cusp of legalizing sports betting, joining the likes of New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The Louisiana Gaming Control Board voted unanimously to approve regulations allowing for both in-person and mobile sports betting. </p>
<p>The regulations still need to be approved by the Louisiana Legislature, but that is seen as a formality at this point. Governor John Bel Edwards has voiced his support for the move, and there is bipartisan backing in the Legislature. </p>
<p>Sports betting will be available at casinos and racetracks in the state. The Board also voted to allow bets on professional and collegiate sports, but not on high school sports. </p>
<p>Louisiana officials estimate that they could bring in $262 million in new gaming revenue each year if sports betting is legalized. That would make it the fifth-largest market for legal sports betting in the country. </p>
<p>Governor Edwards recently signed into law a bill that allows video poker and other electronic gambling machines at bars and restaurants across the state. That is expected to generate an additional $90 million per year in gaming revenue. </p>
<p>So it looks like Louisiana is going all in on gambling expansion in 2018!</p>
<h1 id="Louisiana-Moving-Forward-with-Plans-for-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Louisiana-Moving-Forward-with-Plans-for-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Moving Forward with Plans for Sports Betting"></a>Louisiana Moving Forward with Plans for Sports Betting</h1><p>This week, Louisiana legislators announced plans to legalize sports betting in the state. If the proposed legislation is passed, Louisiana would become the latest in a string of states to legalize some form of sports betting in recent months.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation would allow licensed casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting, with the proceeds going to the state’s general fund. The proposal has broad support among state lawmakers, and is expected to pass easily when it comes up for a vote.</p>
<p>Louisiana joins a growing number of states that are moving forward with legalizing sports betting. In January, New Jersey became the first state to allow widespread sports betting since the federal ban on such activities was lifted last year. Since then, several other states have moved to legalize or expand sports betting, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Legalization of sports betting has been controversial, with opponents arguing that it could lead to cheating and other forms of corruption. Supporters argue that legalization will help generate tax revenue for states and bring new business to casinos and racetracks.</p>
<h1 id="Louisiana-Sports-Betting-on-the-Verge-of-Reality"><a href="#Louisiana-Sports-Betting-on-the-Verge-of-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Sports Betting on the Verge of Reality"></a>Louisiana Sports Betting on the Verge of Reality</h1><p>A little more than a week ago, Louisiana lawmakers overwhelmingly voted in favor of a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. If signed into law by Governor John Bel Edwards, the bill would allow for widespread sports betting at casinos and horse tracks throughout Louisiana.</p>
<p>The vote was seen as something of a surprise, as similar measures had failed in the past. But with pressure from casino owners and the potential for increased tax revenue,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> legislators appear to have finally come around on the idea of sports betting.</p>
<p>Governor Edwards has not yet stated whether he plans to sign the bill into law, but he is widely expected to do so. And if he does, Louisiana will become the latest state to legalize some form of sports betting.</p>
<p>Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma and West Virginia have all passed legislation authorizing sports betting in some form or another.</p>
<p>Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting way back in 1949 and other states followed suit over the years. But it wasn’t until 1992 that Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide.</p>
<p>PASPA was struck down by the Supreme Court last year however, and that’s when things started to change. Since then multiple states have legalized various forms of sports betting and more are likely to follow in the coming months and years.</p>
<p>So why is this such a big deal? Well for one thing it’s a major moneymaker. The American Gaming Association estimates that US bettors placed $150 billion on illegal bets last year alone. legalizing and regulating sports betting would bring much of that business out into the open and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for states across the country.</p>
<p>It would also create jobs and could help boost tourism industries in states that legalize it. Finally it would give fans another way to enjoy their favorite sporting events while also having a chance to make a little money on the side.</p>
<h1 id="Louisiana-Looks-to-Join-Other-States-in-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Louisiana-Looks-to-Join-Other-States-in-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Looks to Join Other States in Legalized Sports Betting"></a>Louisiana Looks to Join Other States in Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>Louisiana is looking to join a growing number of states in legalizing sports betting, with the state’s gambling commission recently voting to allow the practice.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Gaming Control Board said that it wants legislators to approve rules that would let casinos and other gambling establishments offer bets on professional and college sports games. The board also said that it wants legislators to approve a law that would allow fantasy sports betting.</p>
<p>“This is an opportunity for the state,” said Ronnie Jones, executive director of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. “It’s an opportunity to regulate something that is happening illegally on the street.”</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting is currently allowed in Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. In addition, lawmakers in Rhode Island are considering a bill that would legalize sports betting, while lawmakers in Pennsylvania are considering a bill that would legalize both sports betting and online gambling.</p>
<p>While some legislators are hesitant to approve laws that would legalize sports betting and online gambling, Jones believes that such laws could help generate revenue for the state.</p>
<p>“In the short term there may be some cannibalization (of casino revenue), but over time we think it will grow because people love their sporting events,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="When-Will-Sports-Betting-be-Legal-in-Louisiana"><a href="#When-Will-Sports-Betting-be-Legal-in-Louisiana" class="headerlink" title="When Will Sports Betting be Legal in Louisiana?"></a>When Will Sports Betting be Legal in Louisiana?</h1><p>Now that the US Supreme Court has overturned the federal ban on sports betting, it’s up to each individual state to decide whether they want to legalize it or not. Louisiana is one of several states that are still figuring out what they want to do.</p>
<p>There are a lot of pros and cons to consider when it comes to legalizing sports betting. On the one hand, it could bring in a lot of revenue for the state, and it could create jobs in the gaming industry. On the other hand, there is a risk of gambling addiction, and there could be negative consequences for people who lose money gambling.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been a definitive answer from Louisiana lawmakers about whether they will legalize sports betting. Some people are in favor of it, while others are against it. It’s likely that there will be a lot of debate on this issue before a decision is made.</p>
<p>If Louisiana does choose to legalize sports betting, there are a few things that need to be considered. First of all, what kind of regulations would be put in place? Would people have to be 21 or older to gamble? What would the tax rates be? How would the money be distributed? These are just some of the questions that need to be answered before sports betting can become legal in Louisiana.</p>
<p>It will probably be awhile before we know what Louisiana’s final decision is on sports betting. In the meantime, you can keep track of all the latest news and updates on our website. We will keep you posted on any new developments as they happen.</p>
