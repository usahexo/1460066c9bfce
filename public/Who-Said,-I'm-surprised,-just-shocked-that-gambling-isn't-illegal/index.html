        <h1 id="Who-Said-I’m-surprised-just-shocked-that-gambling-isn’t-illegal"><a href="#Who-Said-I’m-surprised-just-shocked-that-gambling-isn’t-illegal" class="headerlink" title="Who Said, I’m surprised, just shocked that gambling isn’t illegal?"></a>Who Said, I’m surprised, just shocked that gambling isn’t illegal?</h1><p>There is a reason that gambling is not illegal in the majority of the United States. Gambling provides a necessary service to the public by allowing people to risk money on games of chance in order to win larger sums. This has been proven by the fact that, despite being illegal in some states, gambling is still a very popular activity.</p>
<p>Gambling has been around for centuries and is enjoyed by people of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. Contrary to what some may believe, gambling is not a vice that only hurts the poor. There are many wealthy people who enjoy gambling just as much as anyone else.</p>
<p>The main reason that gambling is not illegal in most states is because it is a source of revenue for the government. The taxes generated from gambling help to fund important services like education and infrastructure. Gambling also helps to create jobs and support businesses in local communities.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that gambling can be addictive and can ruin lives. However, this is true of many legal activities, such as drinking alcohol or using drugs. If people are responsible and gamble responsibly, then there is no harm in it.</p>
<h1 id="GOP-Senator-Blasts-Lack-of-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#GOP-Senator-Blasts-Lack-of-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="GOP Senator Blasts Lack of Gambling Laws"></a>GOP Senator Blasts Lack of Gambling Laws</h1><p>Republican senator from Nevada, Dean Heller, has voiced his disappointment in the Trump administration for not including any major gambling reforms in its first 100 days. In a statement released last week, Heller said that the omission of gambling reform from the administration’s agenda was “a missed opportunity to create jobs and provide much-needed economic relief to our state.”</p>
<p>Nevada, which is home to Las Vegas and other gambling hotspots, has long been one of the country’s biggest beneficiaries of legal gambling. However, the industry has come under increasing pressure in recent years as online gaming has taken off. Casino companies have responded by pushing for legislation that would legalize online gambling, but their efforts have so far been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has not made any specific comments on gambling reform, but it is believed that officials are opposed to legalizing online gaming. This position is thought to be largely due to concerns over internet addiction and potential fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>Senator Heller has been a vocal advocate of online gambling reform and has pushed for legislation that would allow states to decide whether to legalize it. He criticized the Trump administration for not including any mention of gambling in its first 100 days, calling it a “missed opportunity”.</p>
<p>In his statement, Heller also raised concerns about the future of the industry in Nevada. He said that the lack of action from Washington could lead to job losses and struggling businesses. Gambling is currently responsible for around 30,000 jobs in Nevada and generates more than $10 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Governor-Disappointed-in-Lack-of-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#Nevada-Governor-Disappointed-in-Lack-of-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Governor Disappointed in Lack of Gambling Laws"></a>Nevada Governor Disappointed in Lack of Gambling Laws</h1><p>Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada expressed his disappointment that more was not done to expand gambling opportunities in the state this year. Sandoval, a Republican who has been supportive of expanded gaming in the past, said that he was “disappointed that we could not get anything done” and that the legislature had “missed an opportunity.”</p>
<p>The Governor’s comments came as lawmakers adjourned their 2017 session without voting on a measure that would have allowed casinos to offer craps and roulette. Sandoval had previously signaled his support for the measure, which was opposed by some religious groups in the state. Lawmakers did pass a bill that will allow sports betting within Nevada, but it is not clear if casinos will be able to offer it pending a legal review.</p>
<p>Sandoval said that he would continue to work with the legislature to expand gambling opportunities and would also look at ways to do so through executive action. The Governor has previously indicated that he would like to see a new casino built in Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Administration-Slammed-for-Ignoring-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#Trump-Administration-Slammed-for-Ignoring-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="Trump Administration Slammed for Ignoring Gambling Laws"></a>Trump Administration Slammed for Ignoring Gambling Laws</h1><p>The Trump administration has come under fire for its apparent disregard for gambling laws.</p>
<p>Critics say that the administration has been too quick to grant gaming licenses to questionable operators, and has done little to enforce existing laws.</p>
<p>They also argue that the Trump administration has shown a general lack of interest in gambling issues, which could have serious implications for consumer protection.</p>
<p>The controversy comes at a time when online gambling is growing increasingly popular, with more and more people betting on sporting events and playing casino games online.</p>
<p>Many experts believe that the Trump administration is not doing enough to protect consumers from unscrupulous operators, and could be putting them at risk.</p>
<h1 id="Bernie-Sanders-Gambling-is-a-Fundamental-Right"><a href="#Bernie-Sanders-Gambling-is-a-Fundamental-Right" class="headerlink" title="Bernie Sanders: Gambling is a Fundamental Right"></a>Bernie Sanders: Gambling is a Fundamental Right</h1><p>Bernie Sanders has long been an advocate for gambling rights, and believes that gambling is a fundamental right for all Americans. In a statement on his website, Sanders says “Gambling is a form of entertainment that should be available to everyone. It’s a way to take control of your own financial destiny, and it’s a fun way to pass the time.”</p>
<p>Sanders has been a vocal supporter of online gambling in particular, arguing that it is a safe and secure way for people to gamble from the comfort of their own homes. He has also spoken out against laws that prohibit or restrict gambling, insisting that they are nothing more than attempts by special interest groups to protect their own profits.</p>
<p>Sanders’ views on gambling have come under fire from some quarters, with critics arguing that gambling can be addictive and harmful to people’s health and finances. But Sanders remains undeterred, arguing that with proper regulation and oversight, gambling can be a safe and enjoyable pastime for millions of Americans.</p>
