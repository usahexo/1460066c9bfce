        <h1 id="Red88-Crushes-Vegas-with-Historic-upset"><a href="#Red88-Crushes-Vegas-with-Historic-upset" class="headerlink" title="Red88 Crushes Vegas with Historic upset!"></a>Red88 Crushes Vegas with Historic upset!</h1><p>The Red88 team has pulled off one of the most shocking upsets in recent memory by defeating the top-rated Vegas team in convincing fashion.</p>
<p>Led by captain and superstar player “Red”, the underdogs managed to dominate their opponents in all three rounds of play, culminating in a final score of 3-0.</p>
<p>The victory is a historic one for Red88, who had never before managed to best Vegas in a competitive matchup. Many are now wondering if this could be the start of a new era for the team, as they look to make a deep run in this year’s tournament.</p>
<p>Red himself was understandably ecstatic after the win, commenting that “This is definitely one of the biggest moments of my career. We worked really hard for this and I’m proud of everyone on the team.”</p>
<p>When asked about what his team’s next steps would be, Red was quick to point out that they weren’t done yet. “There’s still a lot of work to be done if we want to make it all the way. But we believe in ourselves and I know we can do it.”</p>
<h1 id="Red88-pulls-off-another-big-upset-this-time-for-a-550-payday"><a href="#Red88-pulls-off-another-big-upset-this-time-for-a-550-payday" class="headerlink" title="Red88 pulls off another big upset- this time for a $550 payday!"></a>Red88 pulls off another big upset- this time for a $550 payday!</h1><p>Red88 pulled off another big upset in the world of online poker this week. After taking down a $109 buy-in tournament for a cool $4,000 prize pool, the team managed to take down a $550 buy-in event for an even more impressive $10,000 payday! This is just the latest in a string of successes for Red88, who have shown themselves to be one of the most consistent teams on the felt in recent months.</p>
<p>The current incarnation of Red88 can trace their roots back to early 2013 when they merged with another online poker team. The merger created what would become one of the most successful teams in online poker history, with several members achieving impressive results both live and online. The team has continued to thrive since then, with recent wins in major events such as WPT500 Venice and 7,500€ High Roller at PokerStars Festival Rozvadov.</p>
<p>Red88’s latest win comes as something of a vindication for the team’s strategy of playing smaller buy-in tournaments. While some teams focus exclusively on high stakes tournaments, Red88 has found success by playing a mix of low and high stakes events. This allows them to take down more tournaments overall, while still maintaining their focus on big money events.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Red88 will no doubt be looking to continue their hot streak by capturing some more titles in upcoming tournaments. With over $1 million in winnings already this year, there’s no telling how much bigger their bankroll will get by the end of 2017!</p>
<h1 id="Red88-comes-in-as-the-biggest-underdog-and-cashes-in-on-a-550-win"><a href="#Red88-comes-in-as-the-biggest-underdog-and-cashes-in-on-a-550-win" class="headerlink" title="Red88 comes in as the biggest underdog and cashes in on a $550 win!"></a>Red88 comes in as the biggest underdog and cashes in on a $550 win!</h1><p>Red88 is a new esports organization that came onto the scene in late 2017. With little to no competitive experience, they set their sights on the biggest tournament of the year - The International 8. After qualifying through the Regional qualifiers, they found themselves in the Lower Bracket of The Main Event with a daunting task ahead of them.</p>
<p>They began their run by defeating VGJ.Storm in a best-of-one, followed by consecutive best-of-threes against Mineski and paiN Gaming. This sent them to the upper bracket semifinals where they were met by Virtus.pro, one of the favorites to win The International 8. Red88 was no match for Virtus.pro and was quickly eliminated from the tournament.</p>
<p>Although they didn’t make it as far as they hoped, Red88 walked away with a respectable $550 prize money and invaluable experience that will only make them stronger for future tournaments.</p>
<h1 id="Red88-shocks-Vegas-yet-again-this-time-taking-down-a-550-bet"><a href="#Red88-shocks-Vegas-yet-again-this-time-taking-down-a-550-bet" class="headerlink" title="Red88 shocks Vegas yet again- this time taking down a $550 bet!"></a>Red88 shocks Vegas yet again- this time taking down a $550 bet!</h1><p>Las Vegas has been known for years as the city where people can come to make some serious money. However, over the past few weeks, a new player has been turning the tables on Sin City- Red88.</p>
<p>Red88 is a 27-year-old betting enthusiast who hails from California. In the past month alone, he has managed to take down several large bets in Las Vegas, including a $550 wager at Caesars Palace. His most recent victory came last weekend when he placed a $1,000 bet on Floyd Mayweather to win his fight against Conor McGregor and walked away with an additional $10,000 in winnings.</p>
<p>As if his wins against the casinos weren’t impressive enough, Red88 has also managed to turn a profit while betting online. In early August, he placed a $1,000 bet on Mayweather to win by knockout and walked away with an additional $11,000 in profits.</p>
<p>Red88’s success has earned him plenty of admirers inside and outside of the gambling community. While some have labelled him a “lucky streak player”, others are quick to point out that his success is due largely to his attention to detail and understanding of the odds involved in each bet.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you view Red88’s success, one thing is for sure- he is quickly becoming one of the most feared players in Las Vegas!</p>
<h1 id="Red88-wins-big-again-with-another-upset-This-time-cashing-in-on-a-550-payday"><a href="#Red88-wins-big-again-with-another-upset-This-time-cashing-in-on-a-550-payday" class="headerlink" title="Red88 wins big again with another upset! This time cashing in on a $550 payday!"></a>Red88 wins big again with another upset! This time cashing in on a $550 payday!</h1><p>The Red88 team pulled off another upset this past weekend, taking down a $550 buy-in event. It was their second big win in as many weeks, and it continues their hot streak.</p>
<p>Red88 has been on a tear lately, with a slew of impressive victories. Two weeks ago, they won a $215 buy-in tournament for over $9,000. That followed up an earlier victory in a $109 buy-in event for over $4,000.</p>
<p>Clearly, Red88 is a team on the rise, and they don’t seem to be slowing down any time soon. With big wins in both low and mid-stakes events, they’ve shown that they can contend with the best of them.</p>
<p>What’s behind their recent success? It’s hard to say for sure, but some have speculated that it may have something to do with their new lineup. The team has undergone some changes recently, and those seem to be paying off big time.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Red88 is looking like one of the hottest teams in poker right now. If they can keep up this level of play, there’s no telling how far they can go.</p>
