        <h1 id="Ultra-Seven"><a href="#Ultra-Seven" class="headerlink" title="Ultra Seven"></a>Ultra Seven</h1><p>Ultra Seven is a Japanese tokusatsu TV show that aired from October 1, 1967 to September 8, 1968. Produced by Toho Company Ltd., it is the taxpayer seventh entry in the Ultra Series of kaiju shows.</p>
<p>The show’s title refers to the seven Ultra Brothers, who are the eponymous main characters of the show. The Ultra Seven manga was released concurrently with the TV series, and ran until 1969.</p>
<p>The story follows Dan Moroboshi, an alien from the planet Ultra who defends Earth against extraterrestrial threats as Ultraman Jack. After defeating a human-created monster called Dorako, Dan discovers a second alien plotting to destroy Japan. He transforms into Ultraman Seven to stop him.</p>
<p>While generally well-received, Ultra Seven was not as popular as its predecessor Ultraman, and has been relatively lesser-known in comparison. However, its influence can be seen in later Ultraman entries such as Ultraman Ace and Ultraman Taro. In 2004, it was voted #58 on TV Asahi’s list of 100 greatest Japanese television shows of all time.</p>
<h1 id="Ultra-Seven-live-chat"><a href="#Ultra-Seven-live-chat" class="headerlink" title="Ultra Seven live chat"></a>Ultra Seven live chat</h1><p>Ultra seven. Just the name conjures up images of a superhero, fighting off all kinds of evil villains to save the world. But how much do we actually know about this masked hero? Let’s take a closer look at some of the fan theories and secrets about Ultra Seven.</p>
<p>First up is the theory that Ultra Seven is actually Ultraman’s son. This is based on the fact that they share some similarities in their appearance, and both are from Earth. However, there is no hard evidence to support this theory.</p>
<p>Next is the idea that Ultraman was originally meant to be Ultra Seven. This theory is based on an early draft of the Ultraman manga which featured a character called Ultraseven. However, there is no definitive proof that this was actually the original plan.</p>
<p>Another popular theory is that Ultraman and Ultra Seven are actually one and the same person. This theory is based on the fact that they have similar powers, and both come from Earth. Again, there is no definitive proof to support this theory.</p>
<p>One of the most mysterious aspects of Ultra Seven is his origin story. We know he was created by Dan Moroboshi, but we don’t know much else about him. Some fans have speculated that he may be an alien, or even an android. However, these theories have yet to be confirmed or debunked.</p>
<p>Aside from his origin story, another mystery surrounding Ultra Seven is his true identity. Although we know his name is Dan Moroboshi, we don’t know what he looks like underneath his mask. Some fans have suggested that he may look completely different from how we expect him to look, while others believe he looks exactly like Ultraman. Again, this has yet to be confirmed or debunked.</p>
<p>Lastly, some fans have speculated that Ultra Seven may not be human after all. This theory is based on his powers and abilities, which seem to exceed those of a normal human being. It’s possible that he may be an alien or another type of extraterrestrial life form altogether. Once again, this has yet to be confirmed or debunked.</p>

<h1 id="Sudan"><a href="#Sudan" class="headerlink" title="Sudan?"></a>Sudan?</h1><p>There has been much talk of Sudan in the news recently. What is happening there, and why should we care?</p>
<p>Sudan is a country located in northeast Africa. It has a population of approximately 40 million people, and it shares borders with Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Egypt, and Libya. The official languages of Sudan are Arabic and English.</p>
<p>Sudan is a Muslim-majority country, although there is also a significant Christian population. The current president, Omar al-Bashir, is Muslim. Bashir has been in power since 1989, making him one of the longest-serving leaders in the world. He has been accused of human rights abuses and war crimes.</p>
<p>In December 2018, protests against Bashir’s rule began to erupt across the country. The protesters are calling for him to step down and for a civilian-led government to be installed. The government has responded with violence, killing dozens of people. As of February 2019, the protests continue.</p>
<p>So why should we care about what’s happening in Sudan? There are several reasons.</p>
<p>First, what happens in Sudan could have serious implications for the rest of Africa. If Bashir is able to successfully suppress the protests and remain in power, it could set a dangerous precedent for other African leaders who may be facing similar challenges from their own populations.</p>
<p>Second, events in Sudan could have an impact on global security. Bashir is allied with Iran and Russia, and he has allowed Iranian military personnel to operate inside Sudan. If he were to fall from power or be replaced by someone less friendly to Iran and Russia, it could have far-reaching consequences for those countries’ interests in Africa.</p>
<p>Third, what happens in Sudan could have an impact on refugees and migrants seeking asylum in Europe and elsewhere around the world. Many refugees and migrants who have fled war and persecution in other parts of Africa have crossed into Sudan before making their way to Europe or elsewhere. If conditions deteriorate further in Sudan, more people may seek refuge outside of the country. This could create additional pressure on European countries already struggling to deal with large numbers of refugees and migrants arriving at their borders.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-next-step"><a href="#What-is-the-next-step" class="headerlink" title="What is the next step?"></a>What is the next step?</h1><p>After a long and arduous election season, the time has finally come to decide who will be our country’s next president.  But what comes after this? What is the next step?</p>
<p>For the president-elect, the first order of business is to put together a transition team. This team will help the new president prepare to take office on January 20th. They will work on appointing key members to the new administration, preparing policy briefings, and setting up meetings with foreign leaders.</p>
<p>The president-elect will also begin to assemble his cabinet. The cabinet is made up of the most senior government officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, treasury, and agriculture. These officials are responsible for carrying out the policies of the president.</p>
<p>In addition to preparing for taking office, the president-elect will also be campaigning for reelection in 2020. He or she will need to start raising money and building support from voters across the country.</p>
<p>So what’s next for America? It’s still undecided. But one thing is for sure - there’s never a dull day in this country!</p>

        <h1 id="What-is-the-relationship-between-William-Hill-and-the-American-League-East"><a href="#What-is-the-relationship-between-William-Hill-and-the-American-League-East" class="headerlink" title="What is the relationship between William Hill and the American League East?"></a>What is the relationship between William Hill and the American League East?</h1><p>The William Hill company has been around since 1934, and is a major sports betting entity in the United Kingdom. In recent years, they have made inroads into the American betting market, including a sponsorship deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball’s National League. This offseason, they announced a new multi-year partnership with the American League East division of MLB.</p>
<p>The press release announcing the deal states that William Hill will be the “exclusive Official Betting Partner” of the division. This includes branding on all official AL East properties, including websites, social media channels, and at ballparks. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>What does this mean for baseball fans? Primarily, it means that William Hill will be able to market their betting services directly to fans of the divisional teams. This is a valuable opportunity for them, as baseball is one of the most popular sports for betting in America. It is also an opportunity for baseball fans to learn about William Hill and what they offer.</p>
<p>In addition to marketing and advertising rights, the deal also includes activations such as special events and giveaways at ballparks. These will give fans opportunities to learn more about William Hill and how to bet on baseball.</p>
<p>The AL East is one of Major League Baseball’s strongest divisions, so this partnership should be a great opportunity for both sides. For William Hill, it provides exposure to millions of baseball fans who might not have otherwise heard of them. For the AL East teams, it provides financial support and additional marketing opportunities. It should be a win-win situation for everyone involved.</p>
<h1 id="What-impact-do-you-think-Murdoch-will-have-on-Hill’s-operations-in-the-AL-East"><a href="#What-impact-do-you-think-Murdoch-will-have-on-Hill’s-operations-in-the-AL-East" class="headerlink" title="What impact do you think Murdoch will have on Hill’s operations in the AL East?"></a>What impact do you think Murdoch will have on Hill’s operations in the AL East?</h1><p>Murdoch is set to take over Hill’s operations in the AL East and there is much speculation as to what the impact will be. Murdoch is known for being a ruthless businessman and he is not afraid to make changes in order to improve his bottom line. This could mean big changes for Hill’s team in the AL East.</p>
<p>Murdoch has already made some changes since taking over Hill’s operations. He fired the team’s general manager and replaced him with a man who is known for being a hard-nosed negotiator. He has also made cuts to the team’s budget, which could lead to layoffs in the coming months.</p>
<p>The fans of Hill’s team are concerned that Murdoch will gut the team in order to make a profit. The team has had a good season thus far and many fans are worried that Murdoch will ruin that by making cuts to the team’s budget. Only time will tell if Murdoch is able to turn Hill’s around and make them into a winning team.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-think-Hill-will-fare-against-Murdoch’s-teams-in-the-division"><a href="#How-do-you-think-Hill-will-fare-against-Murdoch’s-teams-in-the-division" class="headerlink" title="How do you think Hill will fare against Murdoch’s teams in the division?"></a>How do you think Hill will fare against Murdoch’s teams in the division?</h1><p>In the early 1990s, Hill emerged as one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. He led the division-rival Phoenix Cardinals to the playoffs in 1991 and 1992 and was voted to the Pro Bowl in both seasons. In 1993, Hill signed with the Dallas Cowboys as a free agent and helped lead that team to Super Bowl XXVII, where they lost to the Buffalo Bills.</p>
<p>Murdoch’s teams in the division have been among the best in the NFL for years. The San Francisco 49ers won five Super Bowls between 1981 and 1995 and have been competitive ever since. The St. Louis Rams won Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000 and appeared in two more championship games. The Arizona Cardinals franchise, which Hill led to the playoffs twice, is now owned by Murdoch.</p>
<p>Hill has faced Murdoch’s teams many times over his career and has had mixed results. He is 6-7 against Murdoch’s teams overall, including a 2-3 record against Murdoch’s Cardinals franchise. Hill has had some big wins against Murdoch’s teams, including a 38-point outburst against St. Louis in 1998, but he has also lost some close contests. His most recent encounter with a Murdoch team was a 2008 loss to Arizona as a member of the San Diego Chargers.</p>
<p>How do you think Hill will fare against Murdoch’s teams in the division? It is hard to say, but I think he will do well. Hill is an experienced quarterback who knows how to win games. He has faced tough competition before and come out on top. I expect him to lead his team to victory against at least one of Murdoch’s squads this season.</p>
<h1 id="What-changes-do-you-expect-Hill-to-make-in-order-to-compete-with-Murdoch"><a href="#What-changes-do-you-expect-Hill-to-make-in-order-to-compete-with-Murdoch" class="headerlink" title="What changes do you expect Hill to make in order to compete with Murdoch?"></a>What changes do you expect Hill to make in order to compete with Murdoch?</h1><p>Hill has a lot of changes to make in order to compete with Murdoch. He needs to improve customer service, make the network more user-friendly, and offer more competitive prices.</p>
<p>Hill has long been known for its poor customer service. In order to compete with Murdoch, Hill needs to make significant improvements in this area. Customers need to be able to easily get in touch with customer service representatives, and they should be able to resolve their issues quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>In addition, Hill needs to make its network more user-friendly. The network should be easy to navigate, and users should be able to find the content they are looking for quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Finally, Hill needs to offer more competitive prices. Murdoch offers lower prices than Hill for many of its services, so Hill needs to catch up in this area if it wants to remain competitive.</p>
<h1 id="Do-you-think-this-rivalry-will-benefit-or-hurt-the-AL-East-division-as-a-whole"><a href="#Do-you-think-this-rivalry-will-benefit-or-hurt-the-AL-East-division-as-a-whole" class="headerlink" title="Do you think this rivalry will benefit or hurt the AL East division as a whole?"></a>Do you think this rivalry will benefit or hurt the AL East division as a whole?</h1><p>The Red Sox and Yankees have one of the most storied rivalries in all of sports. The two teams have met in the playoffs a total of 11 times, with the Yankees coming out on top six times.</p>
<p>Do you think this rivalry will benefit or hurt the AL East division as a whole?</p>
<p>The Red Sox and Yankees have always been intense rivals, but their recent battles have really helped to elevate the competition in the AL East. These matchups have been great for the fans, but they may not be so good for the division as a whole.</p>
<p>The Red Sox and Yankees are both quality teams, and when they play each other, it is always a close game. This can be good for the fans, as they are always treated to an exciting game. However, it can also be bad for the division as a whole, as it seems to come down to these two teams competing for first place.</p>
<p>Last season, the Yankees edged out the Red Sox for first place in the division by just one game. If these two teams continue to battle each other every year, it is going to be difficult for any other team in the division to compete.</p>
<p>The other teams in the AL East are likely getting tired of watching these two teams battle it out every year. It would be nice to see some other team step up and challenge them for first place.</p>

        <h1 id="What-are-the-top-5-good-driving-habits"><a href="#What-are-the-top-5-good-driving-habits" class="headerlink" title="What are the top 5 good driving habits?"></a>What are the top 5 good driving habits?</h1><p>There are a number of good driving habits that can help keep you safe on the road. Here are the top 5:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always obey the speed limit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Speeding is one of the leading causes of accidents on the road. Always obey the speed limit and be especially careful in areas where there is a lot of traffic.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Keep a safe distance between you and the car in front of you.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow too closely, you might not have enough time to stop if the car in front of you brakes suddenly. Keep a safe distance between yourself and the car in front of you to avoid accidents.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use your turn signal when turning or changing lanes.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to let other drivers know what you’re doing so they can avoid crashing into you. Using your turn signal will help ensure that everyone is aware of your movements while driving.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to stay alert while driving and be aware of what’s going on around you. If you’re not paying attention, you could easily run into trouble.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Don’t drive when tired or angry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Driving when tired or angry can lead to dangerous situations on the road. If you’re not feeling well, it’s best to avoid getting behind the wheel altogether.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-top-5-bad-driving-habits"><a href="#What-are-the-top-5-bad-driving-habits" class="headerlink" title="What are the top 5 bad driving habits?"></a>What are the top 5 bad driving habits?</h1><p>The following are the top 5 bad driving habits:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Texting or talking on the phone while driving. This is by far the number one bad habit that drivers engage in. It is incredibly dangerous to text or talk on the phone while driving, as it takes your focus off of the road.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not using a turn signal. Another common bad habit among drivers is not using their turn signal when changing lanes or turning. This can confuse other drivers and lead to accidents.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tailgating. Tailgating is when a driver gets too close to the car in front of them, often putting them in danger. This can cause accidents and increase stress levels while driving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Driving while tired. Driving while tired can be just as dangerous as texting or talking on the phone while driving. If you are not well-rested, you are more likely to fall asleep at the wheel or make careless mistakes while driving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not obeying traffic laws. Finally, another bad habit among drivers is not obeying traffic laws. This can lead to accidents and fines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-can-you-develop-good-driving-habits"><a href="#How-can-you-develop-good-driving-habits" class="headerlink" title="How can you develop good driving habits?"></a>How can you develop good driving habits?</h1><p>As a new driver, it is important to develop good driving habits. This will help keep you safe on the road and may also help you avoid getting traffic tickets.</p>
<p>Some of the most important driving habits to develop include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Always wearing your seat belt. This is the number one safety precaution you can take while driving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keeping your hands at the 10 and 2 positions on the wheel. This will help you stay in control of the car while driving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Looking ahead and scanning the road constantly. This will help you see potential hazards before they become a problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Minimizing distractions while driving. This includes staying off your phone, not eating or drinking, and not talking to passengers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Following the rules of the road. This includes obeying speed limits, using turn signals, and following other traffic laws.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parking properly in a parking lot. This includes using the correct spot and braking smoothly into it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-can-you-break-bad-driving-habits"><a href="#How-can-you-break-bad-driving-habits" class="headerlink" title="How can you break bad driving habits?"></a>How can you break bad driving habits?</h1><p>If you’ve been driving for years, it’s probably become second nature - but bad driving habits can be dangerous, and even lead to accidents. Here are four ways to break bad driving habits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop and think before you drive</li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re behind the wheel, take a moment to assess the situation and plan your actions. Don’t just react without thinking; this is how bad driving habits start.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Stay focused on the road</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t get distracted by gadgets or conversations; stay focused on the road and what’s happening around you. This will help keep you safe and prevent bad driving habits from developing.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Signal your intentions</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure everyone knows what you’re doing by signalling your intentions clearly. This will help prevent collisions and confusion on the road.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be patient and take your time</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t rush; drive at a speed that’s safe for you and the other drivers around you. Rushing can lead to careless mistakes - another common cause of bad driving habits.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-consequences-of-developing-bad-driving-habits"><a href="#What-are-the-consequences-of-developing-bad-driving-habits" class="headerlink" title="What are the consequences of developing bad driving habits?"></a>What are the consequences of developing bad driving habits?</h1><p>Bad driving habits can lead to a number of dangerous consequences, both for the driver and for others on the road. Some of the most common bad driving habits that can lead to accidents or injuries are:</p>
<p>-Speeding<br>-Distracted driving, including using a phone while driving<br>-Not wearing a seatbelt<br>-Drunk driving</p>
<p>Each of these habits can lead to serious accidents and even death. Speeding is one of the most dangerous bad driving habits, as it makes it difficult for drivers to stop in time if they need to avoid a collision. Distracted driving, especially texting while driving, can cause drivers to take their eyes off the road for long periods of time, leading to serious crashes. Not wearing a seatbelt can also lead to deadly accidents, as drivers who are not restrained are more likely to be injured or killed in a crash. And finally, drunk driving is one of the deadliest bad driving habits, as it increases the risk of accidents and fatalities.</p>

        <h1 id="What-are-the-10-tips"><a href="#What-are-the-10-tips" class="headerlink" title="What are the 10 tips?"></a>What are the 10 tips?</h1><p>If you’re looking to step up your productivity, here are 10 tips to help get you there.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>figure out what work fuels you: for some people, it’s hard to get going in the morning, but for others, the afternoons are when they really start to get things done. find what time of day works best for you and try to schedule your most important tasks during that time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>take breaks: it might sound counterproductive, but taking breaks can actually make you more productive. if you’re stuck on a task, taking a five minute break can help clear your head and give you a fresh perspective.</p>
</li>
<li><p>minimize distractions: this one is especially important if you find it hard to stay focused. close all unnecessary tabs on your internet browser, put your phone away, and make sure your workspace is organized and clutter-free.</p>
</li>
<li><p>establish a routine: having a routine can help reduce stress and make it easier to get started on tasks. try setting specific times for eating lunch, taking breaks, and going to bed so you have less decisions to make throughout the day.</p>
</li>
<li><p>set goals: having something to work towards can help motivate you and keep you focused on what’s important. make sure your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely so you can track your progress and stay motivated along the way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.create a to-do list: this is another great way to stay organized and keep track of what still needs to be done. make sure your list is tailored specifically to what you need to accomplish that day and try not to overload yourself with too many tasks at once.</p>
<p>7 .prioritize: not everything on your list is going to be equally important, so learn how to prioritize accordingly . start by focusing on the tasks that need to be completed first and work your way down from there .</p>
<p>8 .take advantage of technology: there are lots of helpful tools out there that can make productivity easier . things like calendar apps , task managers , and document converters can help automate or simplify certain tasks so you have more time to focus on the things that matter most .</p>
<p>9 .set deadlines: sometimes a little pressure is all it takes to get things done . if possible , try setting deadlines for yourself or collaborating with others on joint projects in order to achieve a sense of shared responsibility .</p>
<p>10 .seek out helpful advice: last but not least , don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it . don’t know how to start organizing your time ? need ideas for effective goal-setting ? there’s no shame in seeking out advice from others who may have more experience in these matters</p>
<h1 id="How-can-following-the-10-tips-make-someone-a-better-driver"><a href="#How-can-following-the-10-tips-make-someone-a-better-driver" class="headerlink" title="How can following the 10 tips make someone a better driver?"></a>How can following the 10 tips make someone a better driver?</h1><p>The 10 tips for better driving are: 1) Be patient. 2) Obey the speed limit. 3) Use turn signals. 4) Drive defensively. 5) Don’t tailgate. 6) Keep a safe distance from other cars. 7) Check your mirrors regularly. 8) Look ahead to anticipate possible dangers. 9) Avoid distractions while driving. 10) Remain calm and focused while behind the wheel.</p>
<p>All of these tips are important for safe and responsible driving, but following just a few of them can make a big difference in your ability to drive well. For example, being patient will help you avoid becoming frustrated while driving and making rash decisions, obeying the speed limit will help you stay safe on the road, and using turn signals will help other drivers know what your intentions are.</p>
<p> Defensive driving is another important aspect of safe driving, and it means being aware of your surroundings at all times and taking actions to avoid accidents. This includes keeping a safe distance from other cars, checking your mirrors regularly, looking ahead, and avoiding distractions while driving. Remaining calm and focused is also key to defensive driving; if you get angry or panicked while behind the wheel, it will be difficult to make good decisions in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Following these tips will not only make you a better driver but also help keep you and those around you safe on the road. So if you’re looking to improve your skills behind the wheel, start by implementing these simple tips into your daily routine!</p>
<h1 id="Who-can-benefit-from-following-the-10-tips"><a href="#Who-can-benefit-from-following-the-10-tips" class="headerlink" title="Who can benefit from following the 10 tips?"></a>Who can benefit from following the 10 tips?</h1><p>The 10 tips are for anyone who wants to improve their life. Some of the tips may be more beneficial for some people than others, but everyone can benefit from following at least some of them.</p>
<h1 id="1-Be-proactive"><a href="#1-Be-proactive" class="headerlink" title="1: Be proactive"></a>1: Be proactive</h1><p>Being proactive is one of the most important things you can do to improve your life. When you’re proactive, you take control of your life and don’t wait for things to happen. You identify what you want and take steps to achieve it.</p>
<h1 id="2-Set-goals"><a href="#2-Set-goals" class="headerlink" title="2: Set goals"></a>2: Set goals</h1><p>When you set goals, you have something to strive for and something to focus on. They help you stay motivated and keep moving forward.</p>
<h1 id="3-Take-action"><a href="#3-Take-action" class="headerlink" title="3: Take action"></a>3: Take action</h1><p>Taking action is essential if you want to achieve your goals. It’s not enough to simply set them – you have to take steps to make them a reality. This may involve making changes in your lifestyle or taking risks, but it’s worth it if it means achieving your dreams.</p>
<h1 id="4-Stay-positive"><a href="#4-Stay-positive" class="headerlink" title="4: Stay positive"></a>4: Stay positive</h1><p>A positive attitude is key when it comes to improving your life. If you’re always negative, it will be hard to achieve anything significant. But if you stay positive and focused on your goals, you can overcome any obstacle in your way.</p>
<h1 id="5-Be-persistent"><a href="#5-Be-persistent" class="headerlink" title="5: Be persistent"></a>5: Be persistent</h1><p>One of the most important traits for success is persistence. If you give up easily, you won’t get very far in life. But if you persist even when things are tough, you will eventually reach your goals.</p>

Drivers need to be aware of the risks they are taking when they do not follow the safety tips.</p>
<p>One of the biggest dangers of not following the safety tips is that the driver can lose control of the vehicle. If a driver loses control of the vehicle, it can result in a serious accident. In addition, if a driver does not follow the safety tips, they could also be fined.</p>
<p>Fines for not following the safety tips vary depending on the province or state you are driving in. However, most fines start at around $100 and go up from there. In some cases, if a driver is caught multiple times not following the safety tips, they could lose their license.</p>
<p>It is important for drivers to be aware of these consequences and to follow the 10 tips whenever they are behind the wheel. By following these tips, drivers can help keep themselves and others safe on the road.</p>
