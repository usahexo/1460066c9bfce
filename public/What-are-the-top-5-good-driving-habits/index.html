Here are the top 5:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always obey the speed limit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Speeding is one of the leading causes of accidents on the road. Always obey the speed limit and be especially careful in areas where there is a lot of traffic.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Keep a safe distance between you and the car in front of you.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow too closely, you might not have enough time to stop if the car in front of you brakes suddenly. Keep a safe distance between yourself and the car in front of you to avoid accidents.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use your turn signal when turning or changing lanes.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to let other drivers know what you’re doing so they can avoid crashing into you. Using your turn signal will help ensure that everyone is aware of your movements while driving.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to stay alert while driving and be aware of what’s going on around you. If you’re not paying attention, you could easily run into trouble.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Don’t drive when tired or angry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Driving when tired or angry can lead to dangerous situations on the road. If you’re not feeling well, it’s best to avoid getting behind the wheel altogether.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-top-5-bad-driving-habits"><a href="#What-are-the-top-5-bad-driving-habits" class="headerlink" title="What are the top 5 bad driving habits?"></a>What are the top 5 bad driving habits?</h1><p>The following are the top 5 bad driving habits:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Texting or talking on the phone while driving. This is by far the number one bad habit that drivers engage in. It is incredibly dangerous to text or talk on the phone while driving, as it takes your focus off of the road.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not using a turn signal. Another common bad habit among drivers is not using their turn signal when changing lanes or turning. This can confuse other drivers and lead to accidents.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tailgating. Tailgating is when a driver gets too close to the car in front of them, often putting them in danger. This can cause accidents and increase stress levels while driving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Driving while tired. Driving while tired can be just as dangerous as texting or talking on the phone while driving. If you are not well-rested, you are more likely to fall asleep at the wheel or make careless mistakes while driving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not obeying traffic laws. Finally, another bad habit among drivers is not obeying traffic laws. This can lead to accidents and fines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-can-you-develop-good-driving-habits"><a href="#How-can-you-develop-good-driving-habits" class="headerlink" title="How can you develop good driving habits?"></a>How can you develop good driving habits?</h1><p>As a new driver, it is important to develop good driving habits. This will help keep you safe on the road and may also help you avoid getting traffic tickets.</p>
<p>Some of the most important driving habits to develop include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Always wearing your seat belt. This is the number one safety precaution you can take while driving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keeping your hands at the 10 and 2 positions on the wheel. This will help you stay in control of the car while driving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Looking ahead and scanning the road constantly. This will help you see potential hazards before they become a problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Minimizing distractions while driving. This includes staying off your phone, not eating or drinking, and not talking to passengers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Following the rules of the road. This includes obeying speed limits, using turn signals, and following other traffic laws.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parking properly in a parking lot. This includes using the correct spot and braking smoothly into it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-can-you-break-bad-driving-habits"><a href="#How-can-you-break-bad-driving-habits" class="headerlink" title="How can you break bad driving habits?"></a>How can you break bad driving habits?</h1><p>If you’ve been driving for years, it’s probably become second nature - but bad driving habits can be dangerous, and even lead to accidents. Here are four ways to break bad driving habits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop and think before you drive</li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re behind the wheel, take a moment to assess the situation and plan your actions. Don’t just react without thinking; this is how bad driving habits start.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Stay focused on the road</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t get distracted by gadgets or conversations; stay focused on the road and what’s happening around you. This will help keep you safe and prevent bad driving habits from developing.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Signal your intentions</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure everyone knows what you’re doing by signalling your intentions clearly. This will help prevent collisions and confusion on the road.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be patient and take your time</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t rush; drive at a speed that’s safe for you and the other drivers around you. Rushing can lead to careless mistakes - another common cause of bad driving habits.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-consequences-of-developing-bad-driving-habits"><a href="#What-are-the-consequences-of-developing-bad-driving-habits" class="headerlink" title="What are the consequences of developing bad driving habits?"></a>What are the consequences of developing bad driving habits?</h1><p>Bad driving habits can lead to a number of dangerous consequences, both for the driver and for others on the road. Some of the most common bad driving habits that can lead to accidents or injuries are:</p>
<p>-Speeding<br>-Distracted driving, including using a phone while driving<br>-Not wearing a seatbelt<br>-Drunk driving</p>
<p>Each of these habits can lead to serious accidents and even death. Speeding is one of the most dangerous bad driving habits, as it makes it difficult for drivers to stop in time if they need to avoid a collision. Distracted driving, especially texting while driving, can cause drivers to take their eyes off the road for long periods of time, leading to serious crashes. Not wearing a seatbelt can also lead to deadly accidents, as drivers who are not restrained are more likely to be injured or killed in a crash. And finally, drunk driving is one of the deadliest bad driving habits, as it increases the risk of accidents and fatalities.</p>
