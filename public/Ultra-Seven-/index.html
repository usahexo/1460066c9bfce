        <h1 id="Ultra-Seven"><a href="#Ultra-Seven" class="headerlink" title="Ultra Seven"></a>Ultra Seven</h1><p>Ultra Seven is a Japanese tokusatsu TV show that aired from October 1, 1967 to September 8, 1968. Produced by Toho Company Ltd., it is the taxpayer seventh entry in the Ultra Series of kaiju shows.</p>
<p>The show’s title refers to the seven Ultra Brothers, who are the eponymous main characters of the show. The Ultra Seven manga was released concurrently with the TV series, and ran until 1969.</p>
<p>The story follows Dan Moroboshi, an alien from the planet Ultra who defends Earth against extraterrestrial threats as Ultraman Jack. After defeating a human-created monster called Dorako, Dan discovers a second alien plotting to destroy Japan. He transforms into Ultraman Seven to stop him.</p>
<p>While generally well-received, Ultra Seven was not as popular as its predecessor Ultraman, and has been relatively lesser-known in comparison. However, its influence can be seen in later Ultraman entries such as Ultraman Ace and Ultraman Taro. In 2004, it was voted #58 on TV Asahi’s list of 100 greatest Japanese television shows of all time.</p>
<h1 id="Ultra-Seven-live-chat"><a href="#Ultra-Seven-live-chat" class="headerlink" title="Ultra Seven live chat"></a>Ultra Seven live chat</h1><p>Ultra seven. Just the name conjures up images of a superhero, fighting off all kinds of evil villains to save the world. But how much do we actually know about this masked hero? Let’s take a closer look at some of the fan theories and secrets about Ultra Seven.</p>
<p>First up is the theory that Ultra Seven is actually Ultraman’s son. This is based on the fact that they share some similarities in their appearance, and both are from Earth. However, there is no hard evidence to support this theory.</p>
<p>Next is the idea that Ultraman was originally meant to be Ultra Seven. This theory is based on an early draft of the Ultraman manga which featured a character called Ultraseven. However, there is no definitive proof that this was actually the original plan.</p>
<p>Another popular theory is that Ultraman and Ultra Seven are actually one and the same person. This theory is based on the fact that they have similar powers, and both come from Earth. Again, there is no definitive proof to support this theory.</p>
<p>One of the most mysterious aspects of Ultra Seven is his origin story. We know he was created by Dan Moroboshi, but we don’t know much else about him. Some fans have speculated that he may be an alien, or even an android. However, these theories have yet to be confirmed or debunked.</p>
<p>Aside from his origin story, another mystery surrounding Ultra Seven is his true identity. Although we know his name is Dan Moroboshi, we don’t know what he looks like underneath his mask. Some fans have suggested that he may look completely different from how we expect him to look, while others believe he looks exactly like Ultraman. Again, this has yet to be confirmed or debunked.</p>
<p>Lastly, some fans have speculated that Ultra Seven may not be human after all. This theory is based on his powers and abilities, which seem to exceed those of a normal human being. It’s possible that he may be an alien or another type of extraterrestrial life form altogether. Once again, this has yet to be confirmed or debunked.</p>
