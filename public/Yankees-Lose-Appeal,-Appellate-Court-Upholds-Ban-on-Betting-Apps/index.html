<p>A three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred acted within his authority when he barred the Yankees from using two fan-facing mobile betting apps. Judge Barrington Parker wrote the opinion for the majority, stating that the ban was not a First Amendment issue and that Manfred’s reasons for banning the apps - protecting the game’s integrity and preventing gambling addiction - were valid.</p>
<p>Yankees lawyer David Boies said in a statement that the team was disappointed with the ruling and planned to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Judge Sonia Sotomayor, who voted in favor of overturning the ban, said in her dissent that she believed Manfred had exceeded his authority by implementing a blanket ban on betting apps rather than regulating their use on a case-by-case basis. She argued that this could lead to different standards for other stadiums and teams.</p>
<p>FanDuel, one of the two banned apps, has already announced plans to pull out of Yankees games. The company said in a statement that it was “disappointed” with the ruling and planned to focus its attention on other ballparks.</p>
<h1 id="Mississippi-still-allows-gambling-on-Yankees-games-via-apps"><a href="#Mississippi-still-allows-gambling-on-Yankees-games-via-apps" class="headerlink" title="Mississippi still allows gambling on Yankees games via apps"></a>Mississippi still allows gambling on Yankees games via apps</h1><p>After the New York Yankees were swept by the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series, some Mississippi sports fans may be wondering if they can still gamble on the remaining games of the World Series.</p>
<p>The answer is yes - sort of. Gambling on sporting events is still allowed in Mississippi, but only via apps that are approved by the state lottery commission. And as of now, no app that allows gambling on Yankees games is approved.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Yankees fans in Mississippi are out of luck. Many other gambling options are available, including casinos and horse racing. But for those who want to put a few dollars down on their favorite team, things could be a bit more complicated than in other states.</p>
<p>This is just the latest example of how state laws can have a direct impact on what people can do with their smartphones. For example, in Georgia it is illegal to send a text message while driving, regardless of whether or not you are using your phone’s keyboard. This law has led to the development of a number of voice-activated texting apps that allow drivers to send messages without taking their hands off the wheel.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Alabama it is illegal to use your phone’s camera while driving, unless you are using it for navigation purposes. This has led to the development of a number of apps that allow drivers to take photos and videos without having to look at their phone.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Gambling-via-Smartphones-the-Future-Yankees-Fans-in-New-York-State-Will-Have-to-Wait-and-See"><a href="#Is-Gambling-via-Smartphones-the-Future-Yankees-Fans-in-New-York-State-Will-Have-to-Wait-and-See" class="headerlink" title="Is Gambling via Smartphones the Future? Yankees Fans in New York State Will Have to Wait and See"></a>Is Gambling via Smartphones the Future? Yankees Fans in New York State Will Have to Wait and See</h1><p>In the state of New York, you can currently gamble on your smartphone at a racetrack, but if you’re a Yankees fan waiting to bet on your favorite team, you’ll have to wait until next year.</p>
<p>The New York State Gaming Commission has granted approval for theScore Inc. to offer sports betting via its mobile app starting in April 2019. This will include betting on MLB games, but not yet Yankees games.</p>
<p>It’s unclear why the Yankees are being left out of the initial rollout; the company has indicated that it is working with the Yankees and other professional sports teams to ensure that their games are included in future offerings.</p>
<p>One possibility is that team owners don’t want fans to be able to place bets on their games while they’re playing. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Yankees said that the team supports sports betting but wants “to ensure there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect our fans and the integrity of our game.”</p>

<h1 id="New-York-Court-Rules-Against-Yankees-Fans-Looking-to-Bet-Via-Smartphone"><a href="#New-York-Court-Rules-Against-Yankees-Fans-Looking-to-Bet-Via-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="New York Court Rules Against Yankees Fans Looking to Bet Via Smartphone"></a>New York Court Rules Against Yankees Fans Looking to Bet Via Smartphone</h1><p>The New York Court of Appeals ruled on Tuesday that the state’s ban on mobile sports betting applies to Yankees fans looking to place a wager on their favorite team.</p>
<p>The decision came in response to a lawsuit brought by two men who argued that the ban, which was enacted in 2006, unfairly targeted fans of the Yankees and other New York sports teams. But the court ruled unanimously that the law applied broadly to all forms of mobile gambling, not just sports betting.</p>
<p>“While we understand the allure of betting on one’s favorite team, that craving should be sated at the ballpark, and not on the train or in the office,” Chief Judge Janet DiFiore wrote in the opinion.</p>
<p>The ruling is a blow to proponents of legal sports betting in New York, who have argued that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state. In March, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill authorizing mobile sports betting in New York, but it will not go into effect until the state establishes regulations for it.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in Tuesday’s case said they planned to appeal.</p>

<p>The Yankees sued MLB in federal court last year, arguing that the league’s prohibition on team-branded gambling apps was a violation of their free speech rights. But a panel of appellate judges ruled 2-1 that MLB’s ban was a reasonable restriction on commercial speech.</p>
<p>“Although we recognize that the Yankees may bear some stigma associated with gambling, that does not render MLB’s restriction unreasonable,” the judges wrote in their opinion.</p>
<p>MLB has long barred its teams from having any involvement in gambling, and the league has cracked down on gambling-related activity in recent years. In addition to banning team-branded gambling apps, MLB prohibits its teams from advertising or promoting casinos and other gambling establishments.</p>
<p>Yankees executive vice president Hal Steinbrenner issued a statement expressing disappointment with the ruling.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed with the court’s decision,” Steinbrenner said. “However, we remain committed to protecting our brand and continue to uphold our policies prohibiting our players and personnel from participating in any form of gambling.”</p>
