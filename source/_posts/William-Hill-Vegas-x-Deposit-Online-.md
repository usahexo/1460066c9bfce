#  Sudan?

There has been much talk of Sudan in the news recently. What is happening there, and why should we care?

Sudan is a country located in northeast Africa. It has a population of approximately 40 million people, and it shares borders with Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Egypt, and Libya. The official languages of Sudan are Arabic and English.

Sudan is a Muslim-majority country, although there is also a significant Christian population. The current president, Omar al-Bashir, is Muslim. Bashir has been in power since 1989, making him one of the longest-serving leaders in the world. He has been accused of human rights abuses and war crimes.

In December 2018, protests against Bashir's rule began to erupt across the country. The protesters are calling for him to step down and for a civilian-led government to be installed. The government has responded with violence, killing dozens of people. As of February 2019, the protests continue.

So why should we care about what's happening in Sudan? There are several reasons.

First, what happens in Sudan could have serious implications for the rest of Africa. If Bashir is able to successfully suppress the protests and remain in power, it could set a dangerous precedent for other African leaders who may be facing similar challenges from their own populations.

Second, events in Sudan could have an impact on global security. Bashir is allied with Iran and Russia, and he has allowed Iranian military personnel to operate inside Sudan. If he were to fall from power or be replaced by someone less friendly to Iran and Russia, it could have far-reaching consequences for those countries' interests in Africa.

Third, what happens in Sudan could have an impact on refugees and migrants seeking asylum in Europe and elsewhere around the world. Many refugees and migrants who have fled war and persecution in other parts of Africa have crossed into Sudan before making their way to Europe or elsewhere. If conditions deteriorate further in Sudan, more people may seek refuge outside of the country. This could create additional pressure on European countries already struggling to deal with large numbers of refugees and migrants arriving at their borders.

#  What is the next step?

After a long and arduous election season, the time has finally come to decide who will be our country's next president.  But what comes after this? What is the next step?

For the president-elect, the first order of business is to put together a transition team. This team will help the new president prepare to take office on January 20th. They will work on appointing key members to the new administration, preparing policy briefings, and setting up meetings with foreign leaders.

The president-elect will also begin to assemble his cabinet. The cabinet is made up of the most senior government officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, treasury, and agriculture. These officials are responsible for carrying out the policies of the president.

In addition to preparing for taking office, the president-elect will also be campaigning for reelection in 2020. He or she will need to start raising money and building support from voters across the country.

So what's next for America? It's still undecided. But one thing is for sure - there's never a dull day in this country!
