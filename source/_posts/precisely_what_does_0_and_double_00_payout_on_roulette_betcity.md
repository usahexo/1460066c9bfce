# Precisely What Does 0 and Double 00 Payout on Roulette BetCity?

If you're interested in playing roulette, you might be wondering what the payout is for hitting 0 or double 00 in certain variations of the game, such as BetCity. The payout for each of these numbers varies based on the type of bet you've placed.

In BetCity roulette, the payout for hitting 0 or double 00 depends on the type of bet you placed. Here's a breakdown of the payouts for the various bets:

- **Straight up bet:** Betting on 0 or double 00 pays out at 35:1. This means that if you win, you'll receive 35 times your original bet.
- **Split bet:** Betting on 0 and 1, 0 and 2, or 00 and 3 pays out at 17:1. This means that if you win, you'll receive 17 times your original bet.
- **Street bet:** Betting on 0, 1, and 2 or 00, 2, and 3 pays out at 11:1. This means that if you win, you'll receive 11 times your original bet.
- **Corner bet:** Betting on 0, 1, 2, and 3 or 00, 2, 3, and 4 pays out at 8:1. This means that if you win, you'll receive 8 times your original bet.
- **Five-number bet:** Betting on 0, 00, 1, 2, and 3 pays out at 6:1. This means that if you win, you'll receive 6 times your original bet.

It's worth noting that 0 and double 00 are the only numbers that have a unique payout on the roulette table. All other payouts follow the standard roulette payout structure.

In summary, the payout for hitting 0 or double 00 in BetCity roulette varies based on the type of bet you've placed. Players who correctly predict the outcome of the spin and bet on these numbers can expect to receive a substantial payout that can greatly increase their bankroll. However, like all casino games, roulette is ultimately a game of chance, and there are no guarantees of winning. Remember to always gamble responsibly and never bet more than you can afford to lose.
