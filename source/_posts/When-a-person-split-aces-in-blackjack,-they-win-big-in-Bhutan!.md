#  When a person split aces in blackjack, they win big in Bhutan!

In the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, blackjack (or 21 as it is known in the west) is all the rage. And when a player splits aces, they can win big prizes!

The game is believed to have originated in France in the 18th century, and quickly spread to gambling dens across the world. In Bhutan, however, the stakes are high – and can often result in life-changing sums of money.

One recent winner took home Nu 100 million – that’s around $2,000! The winner, who has chosen to remain anonymous, said he was “shocked” when he was announced as the winner. He added that he planned to use the money to “help his family and friends”.

Another recent winner, Dawa Choden, walked away with an impressive Nu 750,000 ($15,000). She said she was “very happy” and planned to use the money to buy a house.

So what do you need to know about blackjack in Bhutan? Here are some essential tips:

* The basic aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. * Aces can be split into two separate hands (of course this only applies if both aces are dealt at the same time). * If your total score equals 21 after splitting aces (or any other combination), you automatically win – regardless of your bet. * Blackjack pays out 3:2 on your original stake. * In order for players to cash out their winnings, they must first present their ID card at one of the designated gaming tables.

As you can see, blackjack is a hugely popular game in Bhutan – and for good reason! With big payouts up for grabs, it’s no wonder so many people are turning their attention to the tables. So why not give it a go yourself? Who knows – you could be next in line for a big win!

#  When a person splits aces in blackjack, they can really beat the dealer!

A blackjack split is a situation in the card game where the player has two cards of the same rank and decides to split them into two separate hands. The player then plays each hand separately, and if both hands win, the player’s original bet will be doubled.

This can be a very advantageous move for the player, as it increases their chances of winning two hands in a row. If you are lucky enough to get two aces as your first two cards, then you should definitely consider splitting them!

However, there is a catch – if the dealer also has two cards of the same rank (for example, two queens), then they will automatically win one of the hands. This is why it’s important to always make sure that you have an advantage over the dealer, by having more points than they do.

For example, if you are playing with a six deck shoe game and the dealer has 16 points or less, then they are considered “weak” and it would be advantageous to split your aces. However, if the dealer has 17 points or more, then it would be wise not to split them.

#  If you're looking to up your blackjack game, splitting aces is the way to do it in Bhutan!

In conventional blackjack, splitting aces is usually seen as a bad move. After all, you're essentially splitting your chance at two 21s in to two separate hands. But in Bhutan, the rule is different- splitting aces is always the right move!

How does this change the game? For one, it gives you more chances to get closer to 21 without going bust. Secondly, it also increases your odds of winning since there's now twice as many cards in play. So if you're heading to Bhutan and want to up your blackjack game, be sure to split those aces!
