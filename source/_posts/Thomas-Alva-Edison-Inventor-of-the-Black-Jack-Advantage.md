#  Edison's Method Guarantees You Will Win at Black Jack

Edison's Method is a system for beating blackjack that was developed by American inventor, Thomas Edison. The system is relatively simple to learn and using it guarantees you will win more money when playing blackjack.

The premise of Edison's Method is that you should always split aces and eights. When you are dealt an ace and a two, for example, you would split them and play each hand separately. You would also double down on any hand totaling nine, 10 or 11.

By following these basic rules, you can increase your chances of winning at blackjack significantly. While there is no foolproof system for winning at the game, using Edison's Method will give you the best possible chance of coming out ahead.

#  Edison's Secret to Beating the Casino at Black Jack

Most people don't know this, but Thomas Edison was a master at blackjack. He developed a secret strategy that allowed him to win consistently against the casino.

Here's how it works:

First, you need to find a casino that offers a blackjack game with a generous payout for a blackjack. For example, in some casinos, the payout for a blackjack is 6:5 instead of the traditional 3:2.

Second, you need to learn the basic rules of blackjack. This is important because you'll need to be able to recognize when you have a good hand.

Once you've done that, here's what you do:

1) Place a bet on blackjack.

2) When it's your turn, take one card. If you have an ace and a king (or any other two cards totalling 21), then hit again. If not, stay put.

3) If the next card is also an ace, then hit again (even if it would bring your total over 21). If the next card is not an ace, stop hitting and stand your current total.


This strategy gives you the best chance of winning against the casino because it allows you to take advantage of the generous payout for blackjacks.

#  How to Use Thomas Alva Edison's Black Jack Strategy to Win

As a businessman and inventor, Thomas Alva Edison is known for his many successes. But did you know that he also had a winning black jack strategy?

Edison developed his strategy by studying the game and its odds, then designing a system to give himself the best chance of winning. And it worked - he managed to win more than he lost playing black jack.

Here's how you can use Edison's strategy to win at black jack:

1. Know the odds

The first step in winning at black jack is understanding the odds. In fact, Edison developed his strategy by studying the game and its odds. If you want to be a successful black jack player, you need to know the following:

- What are the chances of getting a certain card?
- What are the chances of busting if you hit another card?
- How do card values add up?
etc. Once you understand the odds, you can start using them to your advantage. For example, if you know that there's an 8% chance of getting a 10 card, then you can adjust your betting accordingly. This way, you're not risking too much money on any one hand, but you're still giving yourself a good chance of winning.

2. Use basic strategy
Once you understand the odds, use basic strategy to make your plays. Basic strategy takes into account all of the different possibilities in each situation, so it gives you the best chance for success every time. You can find basic strategy charts online, or even purchase a booklet or app that will guide you through every possible scenario. By using basic strategy, you'll be making smart decisions that give yourself the best chance of winning - even against experienced players. 

 3 Be disciplined and patient Playing black jack requires both discipline and patience. You need to be able to walk away from bad hands, and wait for good ones. And remember - it's not always about winning big pots; sometimes it's about winning small pots over time until you have enough money to take down the table!  4 Have fun! Black jack can be a lot of fun - but it's important to remember that it's still just a game! Don't get too caught up in trying to win - enjoy yourself while you play and relax whileyou gamble. After all, if you're not enjoying yourself, then what's the point?
