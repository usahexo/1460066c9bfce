#  It Pays to Play at Silver Reef!

Irish-born and now Seattle-based writer [Gina Bell](https://ginabell.com/) has spent countless hours exploring the city's neighborhoods, parks, and waterways. She's also an avid casino player, visiting Silver Reef Casino Resort in Ferndale, Washington, about an hour north of Seattle.

"The casino is beautiful," Bell enthused. "It's so well done with lots of wonderful amenities."Among its many gaming options, Silver Reef offers more than 900 slot machines, table games such as blackjack and roulette, and a high-limit area for those who like to bet big. The property also features a buffet, five restaurants, a spa, and a pool.

According to Bell, the casino's location is one of its major attractions. "It's situated right on the water with views of the San Juan Islands," she said. "It's really quite lovely."

In addition to the natural beauty of its surroundings, Bell credits Silver Reef with providing a top-notch gambling experience. "The staff is super friendly and helpful," she said. "And they always seem to go out of their way to make sure you're having a good time."

Silver Reef isn't just about gambling though; there's plenty to do for non-casino fans as well. "The resort itself is huge," Bell said. "There are miles of walking trails if you want to get some exercise, or you can just relax by the pool."

Bell also recommends checking out some of the local attractions. "There are some great restaurants and breweries in Ferndale," she said. "And if you want to go explore further afield, Vancouver is just over an hour away."

All in all, Bell is a big fan of Silver Reef Casino Resort. "I've had some great experiences there," she said. "I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a fun day or weekend away."
