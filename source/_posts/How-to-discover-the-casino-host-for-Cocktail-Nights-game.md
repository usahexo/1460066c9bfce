#  What are the rules for playing the Cocktail Nights game at the casino?

Are you looking for some excitement and nightlife at the casino? Then be sure to check out Cocktail Nights! This game is played with a standard deck of cards and is perfect for those who love blackjack. To play, the dealer deals two cards face up to each player and himself. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting as close to 21 as possible, or by exceeding the dealer’s total score but not going over 21. Winning bets are paid at even money, while ties result in a push.

In Cocktail Nights, players are allowed to split their hands into two separate hands if they are dealt two cards of the same rank. In this case, each hand is played independently and both hands must be placed as separate bets. If one of the hands loses then the other hand still wins provided it has not gone bust. Players may also double their bet if they are dealt two cards of equal value.

One important rule to remember when playing Cocktail Nights is that when splitting aces, players can only receive one additional card per ace. If an ace is split and receives another ace, then this is counted as 21 and not Blackjack. Another thing worth mentioning is that dealers must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. So make sure you bear this in mind when considering your move!
