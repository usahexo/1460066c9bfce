#  Gambling has Been Around Big Bamboo for Centuries!

There has been gambling around for centuries and it’s origins can be traced back to Big Bamboo. Historians believe that the first form of gambling occurred when primitive man placed bets on animal fights. This primitive form of gambling is still popular today in countries such as Japan and Thailand.

Over time, different versions of gambling emerged. The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a game called senet, which was a board game that involved betting. The Chinese also loved to gamble and played games such as mahjong and fan tan. Poker is believed to have originated from an Arabic game called as Nas, which was a game that involved betting on horses.

Europeans were also big gamblers and enjoyed games such as dice, cards and roulette. One of the most famous casinos in the world, Casino de Monte Carlo, was opened in 1856 in Monaco. Gambling continued to grow in popularity and by the 1920s, it was firmly established as a part of mainstream society.

The 20th century saw the rise of illegal gambling operations, particularly during prohibition in the United States. Gambling became even more widespread with the advent of online casinos and sports betting in the late 1990s. Today, gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry and is enjoyed by people all over the world.
